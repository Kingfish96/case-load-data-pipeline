Municipal sanitation departments receive a high volume of rodent-related service requests from residents, requiring timely investigation and remediation to protectpublic health. While Chicago’s 311 system records individual rodent baiting requestsand rat complaints, the raw data is not structured for analyzing operational workload duplicate reporting, backlog trends, or resolution performance over time. This projectbuilds an analytics-ready data pipeline that transforms raw 311 rodent baiting datainto a structured warehouse designed for case-level analysis. The resulting datamodel enables monitoring of case volumes, resolution timelines, duplicate requests,and geographic workload patterns to support resource allocation and serviceeffectiveness within the Department of Streets & Sanitation.
